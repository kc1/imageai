1) You have to install nginx as a reverse proxy to recieve requests and proxy to the directory where you are tunning the node app

2) I'm running "node runlocalapp" in the root/imageai directory

3) using remmina app to connect to vps - pw = Keyring1!

4)nginx "sites-available/mysite" block:

server {
    server_name image1.space www.image1.space;

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header   Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }

    listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/image1.space/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/image1.space/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot
    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot
    ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot


}

server {
    if ($host = www.image1.space) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


    if ($host = image1.space) {
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
    } # managed by Certbot


    listen 80;
    server_name image1.space www.image1.space;
    return 404; # managed by Certbot




}

5) symlink to nginx/sites-enabled
