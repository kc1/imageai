1) Select and send sheets records to bucket1 after adding APN, using apps script "pushToBucket"

NOTE: with the new smartsearch you can also get things using built in lat, lng (eg 46.25,-88)

2) with my computer select those with no contoururl waterurl in last few days - grab and upload sshots to dropbox.
 This will also update bucket1 contoururl and waterurl with upload name. this uses RUNLOCAL.js

3) with "viewDropboxFilesNTL" in netlifyfunction you can get a list of every sshot in the dropbox screentest1 folder/app

4) we use viewDropboxFilesNTL in GAS getScreenshotPaths to match screenshots url with their original rows and update the ContourURL and WaterURL columns

5) next from the sheet get the screenshot path and upload to LLM ,grab response and load into appropriate row
