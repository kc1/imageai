in the role of a real estate investor can you rewrite the following: Nevin, We talked a while back about https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/On-Laura-Acres-Ln-Unit-37_Rhinelander_WI_54501_M95152-31959?from=srp , but someone else ended up buying it. Have you come across any similar proprties recently? I'm interested in properies with a mild slope , a small amount of ground water/flood plain and legal road access. Thank you - Dan
