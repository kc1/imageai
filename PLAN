STEP 1
1) create a post body in apps script with 2 rows of data
2) turn it into postman post request and post to /process locally

STEP 2:
1) search for and get dropbox links and add to sheet1 rows

STEP 3:
1) upload links to LLM get responses and add to sheet1 row

MODIFIED PLAN (until successful deploy)

1) go to db (wisconsinOnSale) and select last 2? days properties with no:

ContourURL	WaterURL	ContourResponse	WaterResponse

next, you need to get the APNs with APNS.js and update the list

grab this as array of json, and feed it through image ai processmany . this should create contour image and water image in dropbox

2) every 3 hours , run script from apps sceipt to get urls of screen shots and update to collection

3) every 12/24 hours ? , get the records with screenshots urls in collection, but no responses and upload to AI, grab responses and update response fields in coll.

4) consider updating sheet with completed records only.

Plan 3 -- sheets is the basis

1) Select and send sheets records to bucket1 after adding APN, using apps script "pushToBucket"

2) with my computer select those with no contoururl waterurl in last few days - grab and upload sshots to dropbox.
 This will also update bucket1 contoururl and waterurl with upload name. this uses RUNLOCAL.js

3) with "viewDropboxFilesNTL" in netlifyfunction you can get a list of every sshot in the dropbox screentest1 folder/app
